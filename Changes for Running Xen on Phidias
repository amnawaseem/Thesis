XENMEM_add_to_physmap is the hypercall for adding its mapping in Hypervisor maintained p2m table using apply_p2m_changes.However, PHIDIAS has static mapping. Hence this will be replaced by just mapping the already mapped page by PHIDIAS to kernel space using its hardcoded address. Shared info page is used for checking pending events and wall clocks time. May be it can be removed all together ???? commenting out BUG after calling this hypercall for now.....
In Xen auto xlate grant frames for grant table, xen-platform-pci driver can be used as a reference. They get the mmio range from device tree and setup grant tables virtual address and gfn accordingly. gnttab_setup_auto_xlat_frames will be called on physical address specifically specified for grant tables in scenario.xml. Initially 4 grant frames each of PAGE_SIZE is allocated. Replacing xen_xlate_map_ballooned_pages with  gnttab_setup_auto_xlat_frames
