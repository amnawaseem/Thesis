Drivers will allocate pages from ZONE_XEN when they want to use grant tables sharing
drivers\xen\grant_table.c is the basic file for grant table operations. We will look into this file and port it
__max_nr_grant_frames returns 4 (legacy support of grant frames) for GNTTABOP_query_size
Now as I can see, remote and local domains shared grant tables with each other. 
These grant tables has grant entries of v1. Each entry has domid, ref and frame. Frame is the physical address of page shared.
For skb packets, new_skb = skb_copy(old_skb, GFP_XEN); 
if(new_skb){
     kfree_skb(old_skb);
     old_skb = new_skb;
