Drivers will allocate pages from ZONE_XEN when they want to use grant tables sharing
drivers\xen\grant_table.c is the basic file for grant table operations. We will look into this file and port it
__max_nr_grant_frames returns 4 (legacy support of grant frames) for GNTTABOP_query_size
Now as I can see, remote and local domains shared grant tables with each other. 
These grant tables has grant entries of v1. Each entry has domid, ref and frame. Frame is the physical address of page shared.
For skb packets, new_skb = skb_copy(old_skb, GFP_XEN); 
if(new_skb){
     kfree_skb(old_skb);
     old_skb = new_skb;
     

Netfront tx and rx packets to netback.
In netback driver, rx and tx are used in context of netfront i.e. rx means netfront is going to receive and tx means netfront wants to transmit
Netfront allocates rx skb buffers in which netback copies data
Netfront allocates tx buffers, netback maps this tx buffers and tx the packets

First we implement tx path from DomU to DOm0
xennet_start_xmit is the function for starting TX from DomU to Dom0
xennet_make_first_txreq  calls
notify_remote_via_irq
Now lets see what happens in netback on this interrupt
